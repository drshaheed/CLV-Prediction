# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction with PyMC-Marketing

## Project Overview
This project utilizes PyMC-Marketing to implement advanced Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction models, specifically focusing on the "Buy Till You Die" (BTYD) modeling approach. The models used include BG/NBD for predicting transaction frequency and Gamma-Gamma for estimating monetary value. The goal is to provide businesses with the ability to identify and optimize marketing strategies for high-value customers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/CLV-Prediction.git
cd CLV-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebooks
Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage
This project contains several Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the data processing, model fitting, and evaluation stages:
- `01_data_preparation.ipynb`: Prepares and cleans the data.
- `02_model_building.ipynb`: Builds and trains the BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma models.
- `03_results_evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluates the models and visualizes the results.
